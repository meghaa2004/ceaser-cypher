# Caesar Cipher

## Description
The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number. This project implements a basic version of the Caesar Cipher in Python, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Installation
To run this code, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the code file.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `ceaser cypher.py` file.
3. Run the script using the command:
   ```
   python ceaser cypher.py
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to choose between encryption and decryption, enter your message, and specify the shift value.

## Example
```
Would you like to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt? [E/D]: E
Enter the message: Hello World
Enter shift value: 3

Original message: Hello World
Encrypted message: Khoor Zruog
```
